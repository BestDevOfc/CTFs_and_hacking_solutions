protections on this binary:
  - SHSTK
      has a shadow stack, if the function return pointers are different (they don't match on both the shadow stack
      and the stack, then the program will be terminated.)
  - NX -> ensures the stack is non-executable (shellcode cannot be pushed and run on the stack)
  - IBT
    something to do with branches?
