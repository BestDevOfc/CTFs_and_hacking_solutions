For this solution we needed to find the credentials used by a NXC spraying attack on a AD network.
We are provided a PCAP file, my first thought was to simply look for SMB2 packets that had successful 
authentication.
Here is the filter:

smb2.cmd == 0x1 and smb2.nt_status == 0x00000000

1) cmd = 0x1 means we're looking for SMB2 packets of type RESPONSE (because this is where we'd see if the auth was successful or not)
2) smb2.nt_status (was the nt auth successful, if so 0 should be the value)

after doing this only ONE packet is returned, right click on it, click follow, then close the new window and go back.
Only the SMB2 packets corrensponding to the valid authentication should be visible now.

After looking through grab all the data needed to crack it with hashcat, I watched this tutorial for that:
