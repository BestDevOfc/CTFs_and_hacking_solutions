If there's some binary data just open it in hexedit or run xxd on it. This was one of the practice picoCTFs, the flag file
was found in the image after extracting all of the files using

Extracting all of the files:
    binwalk --dd='.*' green_file
            **** then run "file NAME" on each file, rename the extensions,
                and work your way from there, this was the solution for the NCL gym, after
                extracting we just ran file and saw one of the file types was a "posix tar", so I renamed the file
                to RANDOM.tar -> extract -> flag/ -> flag.txt

one whole extracted binary file / AP:
    1) "binwalk -e IMAGE_FILE.img"
    2) xxd "flag.uni.txt"
        - read the ASCII text.




Recursively Extract:
    - binwalk -Me decompressed_flag --run-as=root


binwalk --dd ".*" file # Extracts all data
