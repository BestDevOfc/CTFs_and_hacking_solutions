Input 2 JWT tokens and it'll attempt to derive the public key. You may need to set the -e option to 1337 or put it in a loop to try and find an uncommon one,

What worked for me was either https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n/blob/release/standalone/jwt_forgery.py with manually modifying the exponent in code or

https://github.com/FlorianPicca/JWT-Key-Recovery with -e 1337


Then you have 2 options:
1) attempt algorithm confusion now that you have the public key
2) attempt to derive private key if the keypair is unsecure 

recover private key from public key with https://github.com/RsaCtfTool/RsaCtfTool
