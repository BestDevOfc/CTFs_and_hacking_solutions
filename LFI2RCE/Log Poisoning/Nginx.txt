let's say we have a PHP file such as index.php?home=FILE,
any PHP code in that file will be executed and returned to us.
So we just need to posion log files, render those log files from index.php,
and the PHP code will be executed.

log poisoning can be done with FTP, SMTP, SSH logs as well, so keep an eye out for all log files and types.

**** May also be able to use access_log !
